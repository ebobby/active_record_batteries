# ActiveRecordBatteries

ActiveRecordBatteries is a simple library that aims to provide some basic, useful tools for your models without a lot of complexity.

## Modules

- *Paginable*, provides database pagination.
- *Sluggable*, provides slug support for your models, normally used for pretty urls.
- *Deleteble*, provides logical deletes.
- *Filterable*, provides an easy way to filter your results.

## Getting started

ActiveRecordBatteries works with Rails 4+. You can add it to your Gemfile with:

```ruby
gem active_record_batteries'
```

Run the bundle command to install it.

## Usage

To load the batteries on your models you just include the module you need:

```ruby
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Sluggable,
          ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Paginable,
          ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Filterable,
          ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Deletable
end
```

You can use any or all of them at the same time.

### Paginable

```ruby
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Paginable

  items_per_page 10   # default is 25
end
```

```ruby
Article.pages                     # how many pages with the current items_per_page configuration.

Article.pages(15)                 # how many pages if we have 15 items per page

@articles = Article.paginate(2)   # Get page 2

@articles.current_page            # What page are we on?
=> 2

@articles.total_items             # How many items do we have in total?
=> 23

@articles.total_pages             # How many pages do we have?
=> 3

```

### Sluggable

```ruby
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Sluggable   # Requires the model to have a string column named slug.

  slug_base_column :title      # Column to generate the slug from. Default is :name
end
```

```ruby
article = Article.create(title: "Hello, world")     # Create a new article

article.slug                                        # Slug automatically generated
=> "hello-world"

articles = Article.by_slug("hello-world")           # New scope

article  = Article.find_by_slug("hello-world")      # New finder

article = Article.create(title: "Hello, world")     # Create another article with clashing slug

article.slug                                        # Automatically qualified, slugs are unique.
=> "hello-world-kJNLnA"
```

### Deletable

```ruby
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Deletable     # Requires the model to have a datetime column named deleted_at.
end
```

```ruby
article = Article.create(title: "Hello, world")    # Create a new article

article.deleted?                                   # Not deleted
=> false

article.delete!                                    # Delete the record
article.save!

Article.find_by(title: "Hello, world")             # Can't find deleted records.
=> nil

article = Article.
            including_deleted.
            find_by(title: "Hello, world")         # This scope allows to find it

article.deleted?                                   # This *is* deleted
=> true
```

### Filterable

```ruby
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
   include ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Paginable

  # Normal scope
  scope :by_author, ->(author_id) { where(author_id: author_id) }

  # Add a filter and create a scope with it. Filters need to take one parameter.
  filter_by :by_title, ->(title) { where(title: title) }

  # Add a filter with an existing scope.
  filter_by :by_author
end
```

```ruby
 Article.by_title("Hello, world")                   # Filter created a scope.
 => <Article>

 # Filtered takes a hash, the keys are matched against the
 # filter list and the scopes are called with the value concatenating them.
 # It is designed to take the params array from a controller.
 Article.filtered(by_title: "Hello, world", by_author: 1)
```

## All of them combined give you great power
```ruby
class Order < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Sluggable,
          ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Paginable,
          ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Filterable,
          ActiveRecordBatteries::Concerns::Deletable

  scope :newer, -> { order(id: :desc) }
  scope :and_items, -> { joins(:order_items) }

  filter_by :ordered_since, lambda { |since|
    where('ordered_at::date >= ?', since)
  }

  filter_by :ordered_to, lambda { |to|
    where('ordered_at::date <= ?', to)
  }

  ...
end

class OrdersController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @orders = Order.
                and_items.
                filtered(params).
                paginate(params[:page]).
                newer
  end
end
```

## Final remarks

We wrote this code as we built [Chopeo](https://www.chopeo.mx) because we found most solutions to these problems to be more complicated than they needed to be for our case.

Most people build things in a way that tries to work in every corner case. It is a great goal. For this library, our goal was to keep it as simple as possible. It should cover most situations.
